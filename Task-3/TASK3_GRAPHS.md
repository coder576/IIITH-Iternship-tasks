# Task 3 ‚Äì Graph Interpretation & Output Analysis

This task involves interpreting the output results from training the YOLOv8 model on the African Wildlife dataset. The primary outputs analyzed include training graphs, confusion matrix, precision-recall curves, and prediction samples.

## üìâ 1. results.png

This image contains plots of various training metrics over epochs:

- **Box Loss**: Measures the accuracy of predicted bounding box coordinates.
  - Decreasing trend indicates improving localization performance.

- **Class Loss**: Measures classification error.
  - A downward trend means the model is learning to correctly classify the animal classes.

- **Precision & Recall**:
  - **Precision**: True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive)
  - **Recall**: True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)
  - Steady increase implies better detection consistency.

- **mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95**:
  - Key metrics for object detection performance.
  - Values approaching 1.0 mean high detection accuracy across IoU thresholds.

## üî≤ 2. confusion_matrix.png

- Shows **actual class labels (rows)** vs **predicted labels (columns)**.
- **Diagonal cells** represent correct predictions:
  - Brighter color = higher count = better classification.
- **Off-diagonal cells**:
  - Indicate misclassifications between classes.
- Useful for identifying class confusion (e.g., if giraffes are often mistaken for zebras).

## üìà 3. pr_curve.png

- Precision-Recall curve for each class:
  - AUC (Area Under Curve) closer to 1 means higher accuracy for that class.
- Helps visualize performance under different confidence thresholds.
- Sudden dips or flat regions may indicate class imbalance or weak feature learning.

## ‚öñÔ∏è 4. F1 vs Confidence (if generated)

- Displays how F1 Score changes as prediction confidence increases.
- Identifies **optimal confidence threshold** for model predictions.
- Peak point on curve = best balance between precision and recall.

## üñºÔ∏è 5. val_batch0_pred.jpg (or similar)

- Visual representation of predicted bounding boxes on validation images.
- Used for qualitative analysis:
  - Check if objects are detected correctly and with tight bounding boxes.
  - Look for false positives or missing detections.

## ‚úÖ Summary

The combination of these graphs helps you:
- Track training progress and model learning.
- Evaluate class-level detection performance.
- Fine-tune confidence thresholds and identify model weaknesses.

Next steps include expanding training epochs, trying larger models, or optimizing confidence levels for deployment scenarios.
